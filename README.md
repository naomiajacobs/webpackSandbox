Install webpack globally if you don't already have it: `npm install -g webpack`.

Then run `webpack ./sandbox.js bundle.js`.

A new file called `bundle.js` should appear in your main directory. Open it up and take a look.

Open `index.html` in a browser, open the console, and make sure you see the output. Open up the scripts and look to see your code.
